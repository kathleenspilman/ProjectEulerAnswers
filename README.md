# ProjectEulerAnswers

This project is a compliation of all of the code I utilized to find answers to problems posted in Project Euler. 

I am currently using Java to solve, but might revisit at a later point with C and/or Python. 

I am currently working on a Chromebook, and have yet to install Crouton, so I am using an online compiler found at:
 https://www.compilejava.net/
 
I want to make a subdirectory with just the Project Euler questions, so others dont need to do as much legwork.
